                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <div class='description-content'>
                        <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has entered a new phase marked by the rise of <strong>agentic systems</strong>—autonomous entities capable of planning, adapting, and acting over time toward goals. Unlike conventional AI models that operate within fixed boundaries or reactive paradigms, agentic AI embodies dynamic, proactive behavior that can reshape digital and physical environments. This shift demands a <strong>fundamental rethinking of risk and threat models, ethical frameworks, socio-technical solutions, and governance strategies</strong>.</p>

                        <p>The <em>Workshop on Agentic Intelligence: Risks, Ethics, and Trust (AIRET)</em> is motivated by the urgent need to address the complexities introduced by agentic AI. These systems challenge existing assumptions about controllability, oversight, and accountability. Risks such as instrumental convergence, emergent behavior, or self-preservation, as well as intended and unintended harms to individuals and society, are <strong>no longer speculative but are becoming practical concerns</strong>. Similarly, ethical questions about manipulation, responsibility, and human autonomy gain new urgency when intelligent agents act on our behalf—or against our interests—without direct supervision.</p>

                        <p>This workshop invites a cross-disciplinary audience, including AI researchers, ethicists, legal scholars, cybersecurity and privacy experts, and policy makers. Our goal is to foster a shared vocabulary and critical perspective on how agentic AI redefines the landscape of AI safety and ethics. We aim to <strong>bridge socio-technical insights with philosophical and regulatory foresight</strong>, charting a course toward systems that are not only powerful but also principled, accountable, and aligned with human and societal values.</p>

                                <h4>Talk: Game Theory for AI Agents</h4>
                                <p>As agentic AI systems are deployed, they will increasingly interact with each other. Game theory is the study of entities that interact while pursuing their own objectives. But AI agents are not like humans or groups of humans. Their memories can be wiped, multiple copies of them can be spun up, they can be run in simulation, and their source code can be analyzed. In principle, the framework of game theory is flexible enough to accommodate all these aspects; but historically, the game theory community has not focused on them, and some of the relevant work has taken place in philosophy. I will discuss our work on these topics, with a focus on enabling AI agents to be cooperative in ways that humans cannot. (No previous background in game theory required.)</p>

                                <h4>Talk: MobiTwin: Toward Building End-to-End Framework for User's Mobile Twins</h4>
                                <p>Understanding and anticipating user behavior at scale requires the ability to construct realistic digital twins that emulate real human decision-making. We introduce MobiTwin, an end-to-end framework for high-fidelity mobile user simulation designed to overcome key limitations of existing approaches: limited decision-making diversity, inability in multi-option processing, and limited interaction fidelity within mobile environments. To address, MobiTwin integrates four core components including adaptive persona generation, self-evolving contextual memory, multi-faceted behavioral simulation, and high-fidelity mobile device control to model user cognition and behavior. Unlike traditional methods that model user behaviors in isolation, MobiTwin enables simulated agents to perform joint decision-making across multiple options, closely mirroring how real users navigate cognitive trade-offs under screen. Empirical evaluations on both public benchmarks and proprietary datasets demonstrate that MobiTwin achieved significant gain in decision prediction accuracy, more robustness to positional bias, and computational efficiency compared to leading baselines. Beyond quantitative performance, we validate the fidelity of simulated agents through reasoning and emotion perception analyses, showing substantial behavioral alignment with human data.</p>
